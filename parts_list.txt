 3x    short usb a to mini b  cables
 1x    1.5m long usb a to mini b cable for joystick 
as needed some servo extension leads

as needed signal wire

1x bag of 100 M3 washers
6x 150mm lenths of M3 threaded bar

7.4v 4000mha lipo with deans connector (and suitable charger)

matching deans connector for it and about 300mm of suitable power cable

some strip board  to make servo power distribution boards from 
some .1" pitch pin strips (for servo connectors etc)
some solder

time patience and some thought 

for the 3d printed parts it takes 2x 1kg rolls of pla ( not accounting for
having any bad prints so would recommend allowing for that )

intended for printing on a tevo delta with a 340mm dia print limit 

allow a few days for the printing of parts 

extra parts
----------------------
the joystick can be plugged into the onboard rpi3 and you can control it
via it like a wired remote  to control it over wifi you will need :-

laptop / or linux based computer with usb port to run remote from 
a display for status feedback and wifi , keyboard and mouse/touch pad helps
for programming the arduino nano's and rpi3 

im only writeing the remote pc code for linux if you dont have a linux pc 
you could use another rpi for remote /status monitoring and programming 
i dont do windows or mac or android  you can write your own if you wish 

wifi access point , it is possible to config the on board rpi3 to act as a 
access point for remote control/ monitoring of it , but if you want internet
 access on the linux pc/laptop then you may want to connect it via your home 
wifi , 


(parts not yet defined ) 
-----------------------
leds led drivers and wireing 

some sort of speaker / sounder for the onboard pi3 as it needs some way
of giving status feedback without having a display connected

future upgrades /extras 

2x mg996r servos for camera pan tilt
