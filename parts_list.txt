for the 3d printed parts it takes 2x 1kg rolls of pla ( not accounting for
having any bad prints so would recommend allowing for that )

extra parts needed for both versions
------------------------------------

for debug , testing , programming and setup you will need :-
a laptop / or pc to connect to pi3 ether ssh or vnc over wifi or bluetooth



(parts not yet defined ) 
------------------------
leds led drivers and wireing 

some sort of speaker / sounder for the onboard pi3 as it needs some way
of giving status feedback without having a display connected
