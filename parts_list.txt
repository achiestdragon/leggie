 4x    arduino nano 
 18x   10k 6mm potentiometer with D shaft 
 1x    5v 3A switching regulator bec module (for pi/arduino power)
 2x    3 axis joysticks
 10x   push button switches momentary  (12mm dia hole)
 1x    10a single pole single throw on/off toggle switch
 3x    short usb a to mini b  cables
 1x    1.5m long usb a to mini b cable for joystick 
 2x    25A or bigger bridge rectifier (to give 1v volt drop each for servos)
 12x   6 at 200mm 6 at 300mm long servo extension leads  
 1x    7.4v 4000mha lipo with deans connector (and suitable charger)
 as needed signal wire in a number of colors
 bag of 50 cable ties (that will fit though 3mm dia holes)

 6x 150mm lengths of M3 threaded bar
 1x deans connector and about 300mm of suitable power cable
 1x strip board  to make servo power distribution boards from 
 some .1" pitch pin strips (for servo connectors etc)
 some solder

 lots of time patience and some thought to get it working

for the 3d printed parts it takes 2x 1kg rolls of pla ( not accounting for
having any bad prints so would recommend allowing for that )

intended for printing on a tevo delta with a 340mm dia print limit 

allow a few days for the printing of parts 

extra parts
----------------------
the joystick can be plugged into the onboard rpi3 and you can control it
via it like a wired remote  to control it over wifi you will need :-

laptop / or linux based computer with usb port to run remote from 
a display for status feedback and wifi , keyboard and mouse/touch pad helps
for programming the arduino nano's and rpi3 

wifi access point , it is possible to config the on board rpi3 to act as a 
access point for remote control/ monitoring of it , but if you want internet
 access on the linux pc/laptop then you may want to connect it via your home 
wifi , 


(parts not yet defined ) 
-----------------------
leds led drivers and wireing 

some sort of speaker / sounder for the onboard pi3 as it needs some way
of giving status feedback without having a display connected
