actuator shaft 

see figure 1/. ( actuator_shaft_assembly.png)

place 2  m5 nuts close to the center of the 150mm m5 threaded bar(threads not shown) ,
then 2x 6mm inner dia rubber 'o' rings (shown black on the image) 
with 2 washers

insert 8 short lengths (5 to 9mm long) of 4mm dia ptfe tube (shown as blue on the image)
into the slots on the side  of the carrage halves shown in red

insert  2x m5 (m5*30mm) pivot bearing bolts and fasten in place tight with a nut(nut not shown)

adjust the spacing of the nuts on the theaded bar so they sit snuggly into the carrage halves 
while having a small amount of pressure against the rubber 'o'rings this will remove backlash
but not too much as the threaded bar will be too tight for the motor to turn quickly ,and will
just cause friction and lack of effective power

bolt the 2 haves together using m3 screws (m3*20) and m3 bolts in the outer 4 holes (nuts and bolts not shown)

beraings  on shaft (shown) are added after the above assembly is inserted into the 
actuator_shaft_rail part 

place the shaft and carrage assembly into the actuator shaft rail and it should slide relativily freely
up and down inside the rail , ensure it does not bind and can travel to within 2mm of the ends, (and gives 84mm travel)

fit a bearing at each end and a m5 nut , at one end the shaft the nut holding the bearing should be 
almost flush with the shaft end at the other there should be about 10mm or more of shaft sticking out for the
motor coupling

Note :- removing the threaded bar from the carrage will require the carrage to be dismantled in order to set the
anti-backlash tension
