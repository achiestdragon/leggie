actuator shaft 

see figure 1/. ( actuator_shaft_assembly.png)

place 2  m5 nuts close to the center of the 150mm m5 threaded bar(threads not shown) ,
then 2x 6mm inner dia rubber 'o' rings (shown black on the image) 
with 2 washers

insert 8 short lengths (5 to 9mm long) of 4mm dia ptfe tube (shown as blue on the image)
into the slots on the side  of the carrage halves shown in red

insert  2x m5 (m5*25mm) pivot bearing bolts and fasten in place tight with a nut(nut not shown)


adjust the spacing of the nuts on the theaded bar so they sit snuggly into the carrage halves 
while having a small amount of pressure against the rubber 'o'rings this will remove backlash
but not too much as the threaded bar will be too tight for the motor to turn quickly ,and will
just cause friction and lack of effective power

bolt the 2 haves together using m3 screws (m3*20) and m3 bolts in the outer 4 holes (nuts and bolts not shown)

beraings  on shaft (shown) are added after the above assembly is inserted into the 
actuator_shaft_rail part 

place the shaft and carrage assembly into the actuator shaft rail and it should slide relativily freely
up and down inside the rail , ensure it does not bind and can travel to within 2mm of the ends, (and gives 84mm travel)

fit a bearing at each end and a m5 nut , at one end the shaft the nut holding the bearing should be 
almost flush with the shaft end at the other there should be about 10mm or more of shaft sticking out for the
motor coupling
and also fit a bearing to each m5 pivot bolts and fasten each in place with another m5 nut

Note :- removing the threaded bar from the carrage will require the carrage to be dismantled in order to set the
anti-backlash tension 

leg assembly :-

fig2 upper_leg_assembled.png

fasten the 2 leg halves together using 4 m3 nuts and bolts  insert the assembled actuator rails and fasten them in place
also with m3 nuts and bolts  taking note that  at the outer ends the bolts go up though the leg halves then though the actuators , and at the coupling ends the bolts go down though the actuator rail into the leg halves , this is so the excess threads don't bind with other parts , you will also have to attach a pair of pivot arms to the ends of the pivot
bearings before placing the actuator rail assembly into the leg half  

attach the shaft coupler to the actuator (you need to push it though the motor output shaft hole),
then mount the motor m4* (lengths for these need to be measured so as there not too long )

and mount the pots (you may have to widen the pot mounting holes) the wireing pins for the pot should face out as per fig2
so you can solder wires to them after there mounted (and also so you can get to them to meter out values when servicing )

there are 2 holes each side of the motor mountings and 2 slotted holes for wireing to pass though
