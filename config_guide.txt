leggie robot raspberry pi 3 configuration


1/. setup the rpi to a monitor with keyboard and mouse attached

2/. configure an sd card with noobs and install rasbian 

3/. configure vnc so you can remotely access the pi over wifi
    for this you will need ether a pc , laptop, or other rpi
    and a local wifi network , that should have internet access
    be sure to setup a password other than the pi default one

4/. install the arduino ide on the rpi , this will let you
    program the arduino nanos from the on board rpi using vnc
    remotely so you don't have to connect programming cables
    each time 

5/. create a directory(folder) in /home/pi/Documents  called
    git ,  and open a terminal

> cd Doc*
> cd git
> git clone https://github.com/achiestdragon/leggie.git

this should copy all the needed leggie files to a folder
called leggie in the git folder

6/. now is as good a time as any to program the joystick
    arduino ,  connect the ardruno nano for the joystick
    to the pi by usb , start the ardruino ide set the 
    board and programmer type  load the file USBjoystick1
    and upload it to the nano
    when done go to the serial monitor in the arduino ide
    and you should see the values change with the moment
    of the joysticks and the state of the buttons

6/. power down the rpi , remove keyboard, mouse hdmi and
    joystick
    power up and connect to it using vnc ,you will need
    to set the display resolution on the pi to be at least
    1024*768 as the default 640*480 is too small for the
    arduino window

7/. you  can mount the rpi on the robot and connect up the 
    3 servo control arduinos  , you should now see them as 
    dev/ttyUSB0 1 and 2 in the ardruino ide
    in the ide set the board type as arduino nano and the
    programmer type as arduino as ISP
    
8/. load the file leggie_ardruino_pid in the ide and compile
    select port dev/ttyUSB0 and upload
    wait for it to complete  then select port  dev/ttyUSB1
    upload and wait , and the same for dev/ttyUSB2
    you now should have all 3 arduinos programmed 
    you can check by selecting them by there serial port
    and opening the serial monitor in the arduino ide
    where you should see status messages by pressing the foot
    switches on the legs connected to it 
    
9/. if you are wanting to use the joystick wired to the robot
    then the joystick to the rpi via the remaining usb port
    ( this should make it /dev/ttyUSB3) but it may not be in 
    that order , not that it matters the code sorts it 
    
10/. with robot servo power off but the pi3 and arduino nano's 
    powered , though vnc to the pi cd to 
    ~/Documents/git/leggie/rpi3_code in a console and type
    > python srlpy.py  
    this should run the serial test program  you should get an 
    output from all leg controllers , by pressing the foot switch
    of each leg in any order and if connected a stream of data
    from the joystick that changes when you move the sticks
    or press buttons 
    if so all is good so far

11/. while still connected in the console 
     ctrl+z to exit srlpy.py and type
     > python main.py
     the robot main code should start 
     
     at present this code is not complete but should correctly 
     detect the serial ports and connected devices , and provide
     status messages
